Hi 👋, I'm Julio Cesar and I'm currently majoring in Computer Engineering at CEFET-MG. I am very interested in _Web Development_ (Back and Front development) and I want to learn more about _Desktop development_, _Computer Vision_ and _Artificial Intelligence_.

- 📚 I like to read mangas _(and I believe you already noticed that.)_
- 🎮 I like to play in my free time too.
- ❓ <b>𝘾𝙍𝙊𝙎</b> comes from: <b>𝘾</b>esar <b>𝙍</b>ocha <b>𝙊</b>liveira <b>𝙎</b>ouza.

**Hakki (학기):** Hakki consists of a system for CEFET-MG students to register and see reviews  given by other students to the institution's professors. With a **[Web System](https://github.com/julioCROS/Hakki-Web)** for registering and viewing reviews, a **[Chrome Extension](https://github.com/julioCROS/Hakki-Extension)** for script injection that makes it possible to see such reviews on the SIGAA page and an **[API](https://github.com/julioCROS/Hakki-API)** to receive and send these database through the system.
